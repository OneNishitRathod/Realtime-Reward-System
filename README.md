# Realtime-Reward-System
Integrating a real-time rewards engine with a digital onboarding system, this project uses Flask and Redis to process transactions, a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend for smooth user registration, and a Flask service with NumPy for ML-powered, context-aware notificationsâ€”all built for scalability and efficiency.
